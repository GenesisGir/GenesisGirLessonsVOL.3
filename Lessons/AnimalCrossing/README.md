# module requirements

In order to run this program without issues or any future projects of mine that use playsound, pygame you must
first install them with pip in terminal in order to not get errors or hear sound.

install modules

- playsound==1.2.2 (using to output audio)
- pygame==2.1.2 (virtually does the same thing as playsound but more flexible)

documentation on these modules and what they do can be found at the following links

The 2nd project in the GenesisGir lessons vol.3 comes a fun interactive program from nintendo! Play, explore,
create and make new friends and get in tricky situations in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp! Alot of functionalities being used from chapter 3 automatetheboringstuff from creating our own functions , def statements, parameters, return statements, global statements, try and except statements that stop your code from exception crashes and much much more! defining functions helps with deduplicating code and making less prone errors within your source code and helps organize your source code, also it makes your code more readable as you progress as things begin to get more intricate and complex as you get better in python. So do give everything a breeze and a stare as your learning and dont rush your learning curve everybody learns differently and at various paces I'm sure you will get it!

# Learn , Discover , Explore

In this .py you can learn a lot from what I did and discover methods I use to make things work! This is very Novice level friendly and if you find yourself lost just make sure to look at the comments next to the lines of code to see what each line does and why I added those functions and how they are being implemented. again this is very user friendly and very easy to understand I made these projects so someone new to coding can learn and develop skills like I have to make their own programs and have somewhere to start in the world of coding!
