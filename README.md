The third installmeant of the lessons I've been making to teach novices and beginners alike how to code , In Moore Kitsune Lessons VOL.3 you'll learn more functions like defining your own functions and more a lot to learn from this repo. Free & open source code to review and learn, Creative workflows and tips that give you that learning edge from other websites but being self taught comes with various perks being able to search any term on the web and discover new  GGLV3's aim is to make you learn coding as fast and efficeint as possible and anyone can download this repo and learn to program their own programs in the first day of reading through it. of course I hope you all enjoy this installmeant of my lessons and best wishes to your learning paths!

- 2 .py files
- Tutorials on python source code
- tips and tricks to use in your own code

 Learn, Explore, Study!

High value and love embedded into every code snippet any novice like me with-100 can see the workflows and why certain decisions were made and how they can implemeant them themselves in their own programs to enhance or develop  better coding or programming skills. Again these are just a progress board and nothing in these tutorials will set in stone that you will learn as fast as the next guy but it will make sure your on the right way to making your very own programs/software!
